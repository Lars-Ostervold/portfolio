        I'm a disciple of Jesus, husband, father, and nerd. I'm currently working as a researcher at
        Dow in Houston, TX, but my passion is learning and creating - whether that's writing code, 
        writing words, or whatever else my is consuming my mind at the moment. Some of my favorite
        projects are below, but more are buried in the links above ðŸ˜Š.
